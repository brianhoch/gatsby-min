When Macmillan Learning reorganized the digital product organization, I facilitated the co-creation of an improved workflow for researching, designing, implementing, and shipping digital learning products.

## Task ##

My responsibility was to represent the design team and end userâ€™s needs in a new workflow for researching, designing, implementing, and shipping digital learning products. I co-created this workflow with our ProductOps leader.

## Actions ##

To determine what changes would provide the greatest impact, I proposed the following process to my counterpart in ProductOps.

1. **Listen:** Research the joys and pains that team members are feeling as they collaborate across disciplines
2. **Align:** Gather our findings, create metrics to validate we've accomplished the goal
3. **Test:** Prototype solutions and evaluate them against the metrics
4. **Rally:** Review the proven intervention and implement it across the team

### Understand the teams (Listen) ###

Given our design team's focus on participatory decision making and co-creation, I decided to gather information from individual members of the design team, not only the design managers. Design managers agreed this gave me more complete information and gave a jump start establishing buy-in from the team on the new process. I conducted a workshop with the full design team to identify strong points and opportunities to improve in our collaboration with Product.

In order to move quickly, I agreed with the ProductOps lead to focus discovery efforts within our respective teams, drawing on existing relationships and norms within the teams.

### Discover shared objectives (Align) ###

#### Opportunities to improve ####

Design most wanted to improve in these areas:

- Understand the criteria for making decisions about what user needs and features to prioritize
- Prioritize improvements to the user experience currently considered out of scope

Product hoped to improve:

- Maintain forward momentum on prioritized work
- Keep the schedule predictable

#### Aligning identified needs ####

I determined with my partner in Product that the teams' requests centered on:

- _Align_ on decision criteria
- _Align_ on decisions made over the course of the initiative.
- _Execute_ the aligned decisions to schedule

Reviewing these needs with my counterpart in Product, we agreed to address these requests by adjusting checkpoints in the high level product development workflow.

### Experiment for fit (Test) ###

Based on those needs, I worked with my counterpart in Product to create a new workflow that included these changes:

> **_Sketch of applicable section(s) of the workflow?_**
>
> Generic high level workflow with the following highlights
>
> - Co-create initiative OKRs
> - Span noting that OKRs used for decision making over the course of the initiative

1. Teams align on the goals and intended outcomes for an initiative from the start by co-creating objectives and key results (OKRs) for the initiative.
2. Use those OKRs to guide decision making over the course of the initiative.
3. Commit to support and execute team decisions based in the OKRs, even if individuals disagree.

Evaluating the new workflow against our acceptance criteria with Design and Product leaders, we added the following.

- "50 foot view" listing research, ideation, and decision making methods or "plays" to help teams identify the best method for their situation
- Discrete step to schedule research and design work
- Workflow step to document and prioritize improvements to the user experience out of scope for the current OKRs

With these updates and the leader approval, we presented the new workflow to the team. Leaders and team members in Design and Product signed off and we started using the new workflow in each project team.

### Scoring our success (Rally) ###

To verify that these changes to the workflow accomplished our goals, I created an instrument to measure team members' perception of their team's

- Alignment on decision criteria across Product and Design
- Ability to make clear decisions and act on them together
- Alignment on decisions made during the initiative

> **Screenshot or sketch of the instrument or its questions**
> Just a glimpse, not enough to read out the full survey

I gathered baseline values with the design and product teams then ran the survey on a recurring basis to verify progress on our key metrics.

## Result ##

After deploying the new workflow and recurring pulse survey Product and Design teams reported

- Increased feeling of alignment when making decisions and executing them over the course of the initiative
- Increased sense of predictible forward progress over the course of the initiative
