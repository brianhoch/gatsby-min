When Macmillan Learning reorganized the digital product organization, I jumped at the opportunity to co-create an improved workflow for researching, designing, implementing, and shipping digital learning products.

## Task ##

My responsibility was to represent the design team and end userâ€™s needs in a new workflow for researching, designing, implementing, and shipping digital learning products. I co-created this workflow with our ProductOps leader.

## Actions ##

To determine what changes would provide the greatest impact, I proposed following this process to my counterpart in ProductOps.

1. **Listen:** Research the joys and pains that team members are feeling as they collaborate across disciplines
2. **Align:** Gather our findings, create metrics to validate we've accomplished the goal
3. **Test:** Prototype solutions and evaluate them against the metrics
4. **Rally:** Review the proven intervention and implement it across the team

### Listen ###

#### Know your team ####

Given our design team's focus on participatory decision making and co-creation, I determined that in order to gather the right information I would have to involve individual team members in the research, not just the design leaders. Our Product team was more hierarchical and my counterpart believed that input from leads would be enough.

In order to move quickly, I agreed with the ProductOps lead to focus discovery efforts within our respective teams, drawing on existing relationships.

## Overview/Outline for copyediting

See [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L7uDujmbPIFPbpstQqkHno_hYfl8GDSvkHlYOc4lYxE/edit#)

- I researched needs in the design team with design leaders and individual team members
  - Workshop including the full design team to gather input on opportunities and concerns
- I assembled findings with my counterpart in ProductOps
- Design team wanted to align more fully on goals and intended outcomes of initiatives as they start. They saw this as a means to better understand the rationale for decisions made over the course of an initiative.
- Product team wanted to align more fully on decisions made over the course of an initiative and maintain forward progress.
